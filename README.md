# SyncNet
## Project Overview
SyncNet is a tool for synchronizing files between multiple devices within the same local network. It enables fast and efficient file transfer and synchronization without using cloud services.

SyncNet works in local network environments such as home or office Wi-Fi networks.

## Key Features
- ðŸš€ File Change Detection
  - Detects file creation, modification, and deletion events in real-time within a specified directory.
- ðŸš€ File Transfer 
  - Transfers changed files to target devices over the network.
- ðŸš€ File Consistency Check 
  - Compares file hash values to verify synchronization status and ensure file integrity.
- ðŸš€ Conflict Resolution 
  - Detects and resolves conflicts when the same file is modified simultaneously. Provides options such as overwriting with the latest file or creating backups.
- ðŸš€ Initial Setup and Configuration 
  - Offers an easy-to-use interface for configuring directories and devices to synchronize.
- ðŸš€ Logging and Notifications 
  - Logs synchronization events and errors, and provides notifications for synchronization status or errors.
- ðŸš€ Security 
    - Enhances security through data encryption during file transfer and allows synchronization only with authorized devices via an authentication mechanism.
